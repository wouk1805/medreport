## 👋 A Personal Note from a Doctor Who Got Fed Up

Hi there! I'm Young-wouk, and I wear two hats: by day I'm a practicing physician, by night I'm a developer with a serious coffee habit.

As both a doctor and a developer, I've experienced firsthand the soul-crushing reality of spending more time staring at computer screens documenting patient encounters than actually looking patients in the eye. Every consultation ended the same way: "Great, now let me spend 15 minutes typing everything we just discussed..." It was driving me (and my colleagues) absolutely insane.

When Google released Gemma 3n with its revolutionary on-device capabilities, something clicked. Here was a model that could understand speech, run locally (goodbye privacy nightmares!), and had the power to actually solve healthcare's biggest workflow problem. I got super motivated—the kind of motivated that makes you forget what sunlight looks like.

After many days of coding, many more nights than I care to admit, and way too many tutorials on how to use video editors—because apparently presenting your work is just as important as building it—MedReport was born.

The vision was simple: What if every natural conversation between doctor and patient could automatically become professional documentation? What if we could give physicians back those precious hours to do what they love most—actually care for people?

Turns out, with a lot of determination, Gemma 3n's incredible architecture, and some fine-tuning magic, we could make it happen. And yes, it works.

So grab a coffee if you'd like, and let me show you how we're about to transform healthcare documentation forever.

## 🚨 The Problem: Healthcare's Documentation Crisis

Healthcare faces a critical workflow challenge that directly impacts both patient care quality and physician wellbeing:

**Current State:**
- **10-15 minutes per consultation** lost to post-documentation tasks
- **2+ hours daily** spent by physicians on paperwork instead of patient care
- **60% of physician** burnout directly attributed to administrative burden
- **25% of global population** faces language barriers in healthcare access
- **Privacy concerns** prevent adoption of cloud-based medical AI solutions

**Technical Gap:** No existing system can process natural doctor-patient conversations in real-time while maintaining complete privacy and generating professional medical documentation.

**Why Current Solutions Fail:**
- **Medical Secretaries:** Limited availability, expensive, still require dictation time
- **Dictation Software:** Requires formal post-consultation dictation, breaks consultation flow
- **EHR Systems:** Focus on manual data entry rather than natural conversation capture
- **Cloud AI Services:** Privacy concerns make them unusable in confidential medical settings

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Advanced GUI Development & User Experience

The application features a sophisticated GUI developed with Tkinter, providing a fluid, interactive UI/UX experience. Special attention was given to creating non-blocking threads to ensure smooth real-time performance while maintaining responsive user interaction. 

**Audio Wave Animation:** Significant development time was invested in creating engaging audio wave animations, which not only provide visual feedback during recording but also add a professional, modern feel to the medical workflow. These real-time visualizations were quite fun to implement and bring the interface to life, making the recording process more engaging for healthcare professionals.

**Modular Architecture:**
The codebase follows a clean, modular structure with clearly separated components for audio handling, UI management, PDF generation, real-time animations, and structured report logic. This improves maintainability and allows easy customization or extension for new features.

**Advanced Features:**
* **Dual storage system:** Raw markdown + formatted display text
* **Thread-safe operations:** Proper async handling for audio and UI
* **Memory management:** Smart buffer handling and cleanup
* **Error resilience:** Graceful degradation and comprehensive error handling

### Audio Processing Innovation

**Google Gemma 3n Audio Optimization:**
Following official Google recommendations for Gemma 3n audio processing ([Source: Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/capabilities/audio)):
- **Format:** Mono-channel, 16 kHz float32 waveforms [-1, 1] range
- **Token Efficiency:** 6.25 tokens per second of audio
- **Clip Length:** Audio clips of up to 30 seconds are recommended

**Smart Audio Processing with WAV File Management:**
We implement an intelligent audio processing strategy saving audio as WAV files locally for optimal Gemma 3n processing via Transformers. Audio chunks are processed with 10-second segments captured every 8 seconds, creating overlapping intervals that preserve conversational context while providing excellent UI feedback and user experience.

> **Technical Note:** Currently *(as of 2025/08/06)*, Gemma 3n audio input is not supported with quantized models using Ollama, which is why we use the full Transformers implementation rather than GGUF quantized models for audio processing.

**Context Preservation Strategy:**
- Overlapping audio intervals prevent conversation fragmentation
- Final context integration when compiling chunks into structured reports
- Complete transcription text sent to model (not individual audio files)
- Clinical continuity maintained while optimizing processing efficiency

### Fine-Tuning Strategy

We implemented a comprehensive two-stage fine-tuning approach, separating audio transcription and report generation for optimal performance:

#### Stage 1: Medical Audio Transcription

**Dataset & Methodology:**
- **204 medical consultation samples** (< 10 seconds each), French language (later expandable to 100+ languages)
- **Real consultations** with full consent, OpenAI Whisper transcripts + manual medical review
- **Dataset split:** 80%/15%/15% (Training/Validation/Test)
- **Data augmentation:** Conservative techniques preserving medical terminology (213 samples total)
- **Public Access:** `wouk1805/medreport_audio_204`

**Training Setup:**
- **Base:** Gemma 3n E4B-it (7.89B parameters) with Unsloth framework
- **LoRA:** Rank=16, Alpha=32, targeting audio-specific layers
- **Efficiency:** 42.37M trainable parameters (0.54%), 25.8 minutes on A100
- **Configuration:** 2e-5 learning rate, batch size 8, 3 epochs

**Training Results:**
| Metric | Baseline → Fine-tuned | Improvement |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| Word Error Rate | 81.0% → 31.3% | **-61.3%** |
| Character Error Rate | 60.6% → 22.6% | **-62.6%** |

**Clinical Impact:** Enhanced medical terminology recognition, reduced post-processing, improved French healthcare documentation.

**Published Model:** `wouk1805/medreport_audio` (Fine-tuned for medical audio transcription)

#### Stage 2: Report Generation

**Dataset & Methodology:**
- **Size:** 1,000 curated transcription-to-report pairs
- **Method:** GPT-4o generation with specialized medical prompts
- **Validation:** Manual review for medical accuracy and SOAP format compliance
- **Public Access:** Available as `wouk1805/medreport_report_1000`

**Two-Stage Dataset Generation Process:**

We created a high-quality training dataset via a custom **two-stage generation strategy** using **GPT-4o**:

*1 – Structured Medical Report Creation*
GPT-4o was used to generate diverse and realistic **SOAP-format medical reports** (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan). Each report includes:
- Randomly selected medical specialties and conditions
- Detailed clinical content: vital signs, labs, exams, and treatment plans
- Prescription data annotated using custom `<prescription>` XML tags

This ensured structured, professional outputs for fine-tuning report generation.

*2 – Transcription Simulation*
Each structured report was transformed into a **noisy, natural-sounding audio transcription** simulating real doctor–patient conversations, with:
- Speech disfluencies, false starts, casual language
- Audio imperfections: word drops, substitutions, and repetitions
- Conversational style without role labels or timestamps, segmented in ~10-second chunks

This method mimics real-world consultations and prepares the model to handle imperfect speech inputs effectively.

**Model Choice Rationale:** We chose GPT-4o for dataset generation rather than Gemini to ensure diverse training data. Using a different model family (OpenAI) to generate training data for Gemma 3n helps the model learn from external patterns and reduces potential bias from staying within Google's model ecosystem.

**Training Innovation:** The model was fine-tuned specifically to detect prescriptions in medical transcriptions and automatically add structured XML prescription tags when medications or tests are mentioned, enabling seamless integration with our PDF generation system.

**Training Configuration:**
- **Framework:** Unsloth + TRL SFTTrainer (3x faster training optimization)
- **Base Model:** Gemma 3n E4B-it (7.89B parameters)
- **Method:** LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Learning Rate:** 2e-4 with linear scheduler
- **Batch Configuration:** Per device batch size 2, gradient accumulation 4 (effective batch size 8)
- **Training Steps:** 30 max steps with 5 warmup steps
- **Optimizer:** AdamW 8-bit with weight decay 0.01
- **Dataset Processing:** 2 processes for efficient data handling

**Training Results:**
- **Training Duration:** 5.25 minutes (30 steps)
- **Parameter Efficiency:** 19.2M trainable parameters (0.24% of total)
- **Final Training Loss:** 0.876500
- **Processing Speed Improvement:** 2.1 seconds saved out of 26.4 seconds mean processing time (depending on transcription length, presence of imported documents, etc.)

**Evaluation Methodology:**
We couldn't use reliable metrics like BLEU or ROUGE, since there is no single truth for a well-structured medical report based on one audio transcription. However, we assessed whether the "SOAP" structure was preserved using a composite score detecting:
- Presence of header words (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan)
- Detection of XML prescription tags when prescriptions were mentioned in transcription
- **Custom Score Improvement:** 76.4% increase based on this custom-made score (though flawed, no better metrics currently available)

**Published Model:** `wouk1805/medreport_report` (Fine-tuned for transcription-to-report transformation)

### Architecture Decision: Two-Model Strategy

**Why Separate Models Instead of Continual Fine-Tuning:**
We deliberately chose to fine-tune two separate models rather than using sequential or continual fine-tuning for several critical reasons:

- **Catastrophic Forgetting:** The model might lose audio transcription capabilities when fine-tuned on text generation tasks
- **Task Interference:** Audio processing and text generation modalities might conflict with each other during training
- **Specialization Excellence:** Each model can be optimized specifically for its domain (medical audio vs. medical text)
- **Memory Efficiency:** Parameter-efficient LoRA allows loading multiple specialized adapters as needed
- **Performance Optimization:** Task-specific fine-tuning achieves better results than generalized multi-task training

This approach ensures optimal performance for both audio transcription and report generation while maintaining system modularity and efficiency.

### Document Integration & Report Processing

**External Document Integration:**
- **PDF Processing:** Text extraction using PyMuPDF for seamless document integration
- **Intelligent Relevance Detection:** Fine-tuned model analyzes imported documents and determines relevance to current consultation
- **Context-Aware Integration:** Only includes imported content if mentioned during audio recording
- **Privacy-Focused:** Documents processed locally without external transmission

**Flexible Report Generation:**
- **Complete Reports:** By default, the fine-tuned model generates full, detailed medical documentation.
- **Summary Format:** A short prompt variation triggers a more concise "General" report.
- **Custom Output Support:** Users can define their own report structure by editing the `custom_report_format.txt` file. This file is passed directly as a prompt template, allowing the model to generate fully customized report formats.
- **User Control:** Format selection and customization are entirely user-defined, enabling tailored documentation for specific medical settings or preferences.

### Advanced Function Calling

**One-Shot Processing Efficiency:**
Rather than separate processing layers, our model generates structured reports with embedded XML prescriptions in a single inference step:

```xml
<prescription>
<title>Medication</title>
<patient>Mr. John DOE, 45 years old</patient>
<content>- Omeprazole 20mg daily
- Amoxicillin 500mg twice daily</content>
<context>Gastritis treatment</context>
</prescription>
```

**Dynamic UI Generation:**
- Automatic prescription detection triggers PDF generation buttons
- Professional prescription PDFs with complete patient information
- XML tags removed from display while maintained in memory
- Enhanced user experience with intelligent document creation
